# Game difficulty levels

> <h4>:one: Easy mode</h4>
> The speed of the snake is constant and the food blink at a regular interval. The score increases by 1 point for each food eaten.
  
> <h4>:two: Medium mode</h4>
> The speed of the snake is higher than in easy mode. The score increases by 2 points for each food eaten.
      
> <h4>:three: Hard mode</h4>
> The speed of the snake is higher than in easy mode ( same as in medium mode) and we have bombs :bomb:. The bombs blink faster than the food, and if the snake touches 
> them it dies. The score increases by 3 points for each food eaten.
