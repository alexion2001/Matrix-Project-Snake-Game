# Matrix-Project-Snake-Game :snake:

This is a reproduction of the classic snake game, using Arduino.
This project is the final exam for the robotics introduction course. For more details check this [repo](https://github.com/alexion2001/IntroductionToRobotics)

<summary><h2>GAME RULES :video_game:</h2> </summary>
<br>
      
## Game info :speech_balloon:

The objective of the snake is to eat the food :pizza: to get the highest high score possible. The food offers different points depending on the difficulty chosen by the player. The game ends when the snake bites its tail (in any difficulty mode) or touches a bomb :boom: (in hard mode only).

## Game difficulty levels

> <h4>:one: Easy mode</h4>
> The speed of the snake is constant and the food blink at a regular interval. The score increases by 1 point for each food eaten.
  
> <h4>:two: Medium mode</h4>
> The speed of the snake is higher than in easy mode. The score increases by 2 points for each food eaten.
      
> <h4>:three: Hard mode</h4>
> The speed of the snake is higher than in medium mode  and we have bombs :bomb:. The bombs blink faster than the food, and if the snake eat 
> them it dies. The score increases by 3 points for each food eaten.

      
###  In game mode, difficulty: easy

#  :ant: Bugs in game mode

- Sometimes, during the game, random points light up (don't blink), but don't affect the game. They don't represent food or bombs. If the snake collects them, they turn off and do not affect the score. Reason for this bug: unknown.

- There is a little lag between the joystick and the movement of the snake.  Reason for this bug: too much time passes between reading the input from the joystick and the command to move the snake (requires code improvement).

## Setup pictures
      
The connections between the components are made through soldering, on a prototype board. The components were placed on the board with pin strips.
